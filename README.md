# pythonHausarbeit
This task is dedicated to the development of a Python program for finding the best fits between training data and a collection of ideal functions. By minimizing the sum of all squared deviations (least-square) between the training data and the ideal functions, we can identify those functions that best fit the given data. Then, the validity of the found fits is checked using a test data set. Two criteria should be taken into account: First, the maximum deviation between the training data and the ideal functions should not be exceeded by more than a factor of the square root of two (sqrt(2)). Second, the test data should be adaptable to the functions found. The task also includes the logical visualization of the data.
